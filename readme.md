# What
This is my personal (Neo)VIM configuration.
It comes along with Plug and some custom colorschemes I have created or
modified.

Make sure you have NeoVim 0.9 at least.

# How

Just clone the respository, and run the link.bat file. This script will backup
your existing vim files and make links and junktions on the necessary files and
folders in order to apply the configuration from this repository.


Don't forget to run :PlugInstall the first time you use vim after running the
link.bat script.
